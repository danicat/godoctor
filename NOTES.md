# Scalpel Development Notes

This document tracks the development process, challenges, and learnings during the implementation of the `scalpel` tool.

## Initial Plan

The goal is to create a code-aware editing tool named `scalpel`.

**Core Features:**
- Can create new Go files or edit existing ones.
- Verifies code changes using `gopls check` before committing them to disk.
- For edits, it will take a `file_path`, `old_string`, and `new_string`.
- For creation, it will take a `file_path` and `new_string`.
- The verification process will be done in-memory by piping the modified code to `gopls check` via stdin, avoiding temporary files.

**Success Criteria:**
- A successful change results in the file being written/updated.
- A failed change (due to `gopls` diagnostics) leaves the file system untouched and returns the error details.

## Implementation Progress & Challenges

### Challenge 1: `gopls` Context

While implementing the `verifyCode` function, a potential issue became apparent. The plan was to pipe the modified code buffer directly into `gopls check` via `stdin` to avoid temporary files.

However, `gopls` typically needs to know the file's path to understand its context within the package and the broader module. Without the file path, it may not be able to resolve imports or other symbols correctly, potentially leading to inaccurate diagnostics (either false positives or false negatives).

The current implementation proceeds with the `stdin` approach, but this is a significant risk. The upcoming unit tests will be crucial to determine if this method is reliable. If not, the implementation will need to be refactored to use temporary files for verification, as originally (and perhaps more safely) planned.

### Update: Test Results Confirm `stdin` Failure

The unit tests for `scalpel` have failed. The failure modes confirm the hypothesis from Challenge 1: `gopls check` does not report syntax errors when code is piped to it via `stdin`. It incorrectly gives a passing exit code for invalid code.

This proves that the `stdin` approach is not viable.

**Next Steps:** The `verifyCode` function will be refactored to use temporary files.

1.  A temporary file will be created in the same directory as the target file to ensure `gopls` has the correct package context.
2.  The modified code buffer will be written to this temporary file.
3.  `gopls check` will be run on the path of the temporary file.
4.  The temporary file will be deleted immediately after the check.
5.  If the check is successful, the final operation (creating the real file or renaming the temp file) will proceed.

### Update 2: Temporary File Approach Also Fails

After refactoring the code to use temporary files, the tests still fail. `gopls check` is not reporting errors on the invalid code within the temporary files.

**Hypothesis:** `gopls check` on a single file is not enough. It likely needs to be run on a directory that is a proper Go module for it to correctly analyze the code and its dependencies. The temporary file, even though it's in the right directory, might not be picked up as part of the package by `gopls` without further instruction.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Instead of running `gopls check <file>`, I will try running `gopls check .` from within the directory of the file. This should analyze the entire package, including the new temporary file.
2.  If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other `gopls` commands or flags to force it to recognize the temporary file as part of the package.

### Update 3: The Test Environment was the Problem

A manual simulation of the `gopls check <file>` command inside a directory within the project root worked perfectly. This proves the `scalpel.go` logic of using a temporary file and checking it is correct.

The root cause of the test failures was the test environment itself. `t.TempDir()` creates directories outside the project's Go module. `gopls` requires module context (from `go.mod`) to work correctly, and when run on files outside of a module, it fails to report diagnostics.

**Final Plan:**
1.  The `scalpel.go` implementation using `gopls check <temp_file_path>` is correct and will be kept.
2.  The `scalpel_test.go` file will be modified. Instead of `t.TempDir()`, tests will create a temporary directory *inside* the project root (e.g., `./test_temp/`) and defer its removal. This will provide the necessary module context for `gopls` to function correctly during testing.

### Update 4: Still Stuck

Even with the corrected test environment, the tests are still failing. `gopls check` is not returning an error for invalid code. I have verified that the `scalpel.go` code is syntactically correct and that the tests are running in the correct directory. I am currently blocked and will revisit this with a fresh perspective.
